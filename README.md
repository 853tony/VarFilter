This is a variants filter pipeline for the INFO field from VCF. 
We used the pipeline in gnomADv4.0.0 for allele count, number, and frequency analysis. Also includes severe conditions for identifying ancestries' differences in allele frequency. 
Finally, we summarize all the information to conduct the simple statics.
